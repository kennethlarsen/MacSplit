# This is an example game log file
# The timer watches for new lines containing trigger keywords
# 
# To test: run the timer with --watch game.log --splits splits.json
# Then append lines to this file:
#
#   echo "FILE SELECT" >> game.log    # Starts timer
#   echo "STAR GET BoB" >> game.log   # First split
#   echo "STAR GET WF" >> game.log    # Second split
#   etc.
